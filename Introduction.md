# JavaScript and the V8 Engine

JavaScript is a **dynamically-typed**, **interpreted** language.

## How JavaScript Runs

When we run JavaScript code:

1. It's passed to a **JavaScript engine**.
2. The engine interacts with the **system/environment**.
3. It generates **bytecode** that the machine can understand and execute.

---

## The V8 Engine

The main engine behind this process is called **V8**.

### What is V8?

- **Open-source** and **high-performance**
- Developed by **Google**
- Written in **C++**

### Where is V8 Used?

- **Google Chrome** and other Chromium-based browsers
- **Node.js** (allows JavaScript to run outside the browser)

### What Does V8 Support?

- **ECMAScript** (standard for JavaScript)
- **WebAssembly**

---

## V8 Beyond the Browser

- V8 is **not limited to web browsers**
- It can be run **independently**
- It can be **embedded into any C++ application**

---

> V8 makes JavaScript fast and versatile ‚Äî from browsers to servers and beyond.

# Understanding JavaScript Engines and Code Conversion

> The lower-level we go in programming, the more control and responsibilities we have.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Conversion Basics

To run code on a computer, it must eventually be converted into **machine code** (binary instructions the CPU understands).

### Common Conversion Flow:

- **C/C++ ‚ûù Assembly** ‚Äî Done using a **compiler**
- **Assembly ‚ûù Machine Code** ‚Äî Done using an **assembler**

For **JavaScript**, we use a **JavaScript Engine** to handle this conversion process.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è JavaScript Engines

A **JavaScript Engine** takes JS code and turns it into something the computer can run.

### Popular JavaScript Engines:

- **SpiderMonkey** (used in Mozilla Firefox)
- **V8** (created by Google, used in Chrome and Node.js)

---

## üîÅ How Do These Engines Work?

### SpiderMonkey:

- Converts: `JavaScript ‚ûù Bytecode ‚ûù Machine Code`
- **Bytecode** is an intermediate form: simplified, easier to optimize or interpret.

### V8:

- Converts: `JavaScript ‚ûù Machine Code (directly)`
- Skipping bytecode makes **V8 faster**, especially for **performance-heavy apps**.

## üß© Extra Insights

### V8 Engine:

- Written in **C++**
- Uses **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**:
  - Compiles code **at runtime** for faster performance.
- Actively **optimized by Google** to improve speed and efficiency.

### Bytecode vs Machine Code:

| Bytecode        | Machine Code         |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Platform-independent | Platform-specific       |
| Needs a virtual machine to run | Runs directly on hardware |

---

## üöÄ Summary

- JavaScript engines like **SpiderMonkey** and **V8** allow JavaScript to run in various environments ‚Äî not just the browser.
- **V8** is often faster because it skips the bytecode step and goes **straight to machine code**.
- This is why **Node.js**, which emphasizes performance, is built on **V8**.

---

> ‚ö° The right JavaScript engine can make a huge difference in speed, performance, and application efficiency.

# üß© How V8 is Used in Node.js

## V8 Handles JavaScript Execution

V8 is responsible for **executing JavaScript code** ‚Äî but it **doesn‚Äôt include built-in features** like:

- `require()` (used in Node.js)
- `document` or `window` (used in browsers)

---

## üí° Why Don‚Äôt These Features Exist in V8?

Because V8 is **just a JavaScript engine**.  
It only understands **standard JavaScript**, **not environment-specific APIs**.

### Examples of environment-specific features:

- `require()` in Node.js  
- `document`, `window` in the browser

### These features are:

- **Implemented in C++**
- **Bound to JavaScript** using **V8‚Äôs API**

---

## üîß How Node.js Adds Extra Functionality

Node.js is built **on top of V8**, and it adds **system-level features** using **C++**.

### Example:

- The `require()` function:
  - **Implemented in Node.js (C++)**
  - **Exposed to JavaScript** using V8 bindings

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Why Use C++ for These Features?

- **C/C++** provides **low-level system access**:
  - File systems
  - Networking
  - Memory management

- **JavaScript** alone **can‚Äôt access hardware** or OS-level features directly.

> V8 + C++ bindings let developers use **JavaScript‚Äôs simplicity** with **C++‚Äôs power**.

---

## üåç Real-World Impact

This hybrid model (C++ + V8 + JS bindings) allows JavaScript to be used **outside the browser**:

- ‚úÖ Backend development (Node.js)
- ‚úÖ IoT and Robotics (custom JS bindings like `moveLeft()`, `readSensor()`)
- ‚úÖ Game engines, desktop apps, embedded devices

---

## ü§ñ Why Not Always Use V8?

While V8 is **fast and powerful**, it can be:

- **Memory-hungry**
- **Not ideal** for memory-constrained devices (e.g., microcontrollers)

---

## üß† Alternatives to V8 for Low-Memory Environments

### 1. **Duktape**

- Lightweight and embeddable
- Great for **IoT devices**

### 2. **JerryScript**

- Designed for **very small memory footprints**
- Created by **Samsung** for **embedded systems**

---

> üõ†Ô∏è V8 is ideal for performance. For memory-limited environments, consider lightweight engines like Duktape or JerryScript.


# üß© Overview: How V8 Compiles JavaScript Code

V8 uses a **two-phase compilation approach** to balance **speed** and **performance**.

The goal is to **start running code quickly**, then **optimize it in the background** for better performance.

This is done using:

- **Ignition** ‚Äì a fast interpreter that produces bytecode.
- **Turbofan** ‚Äì an optimizing compiler that generates highly efficient machine code.

This process is a part of **Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation** ‚Äî combining the speed of interpretation with the performance of compiled code.

---

## üß† Step-by-Step: What Happens When JavaScript Runs in V8
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9721e75b-c7fb-40a3-b1e8-6f642f21c8d0)

### 1. Parsing the Source Code

- V8 cannot directly understand JavaScript syntax.
- First, the source code is parsed into an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** ‚Äî a structured, tree-like representation of the code.
- **Scopes** and **variable environments** are also created during this step.

---

### 2. Ignition: The Interpreter Phase

- **Ignition** takes the AST and generates **bytecode** from it.
- Bytecode is like a middle-ground: it‚Äôs not machine code, but it‚Äôs lower-level and easier for the engine to process than raw JS.
- **Ignition starts executing the bytecode immediately** ‚Äî this is fast and gets your program running quickly.

---

### 3. Collecting Type Feedback

As the program runs, V8 monitors how the code is used ‚Äî this is called **type feedback**.

It gathers data about:

- What types of values (numbers, strings, objects) are used.
- Which functions or code blocks are run most often.

This is crucial for optimizing the code later.

---

### 4. Turbofan: The Optimizing Compiler

- If a function or piece of code is used frequently (called ‚Äú**hot code**‚Äù), V8 sends it to **Turbofan**.
- Turbofan uses the type feedback and makes smart assumptions to compile highly optimized machine code.
- This compilation is **slower**, but the result is **much faster execution**.

---

## üîÅ De-optimization

Sometimes, the assumptions Turbofan made (like a variable always being a number) turn out to be wrong.

If that happens, V8 will **de-optimize** the code:

- It throws away the optimized machine code.
- Returns to running the original bytecode with Ignition.

This process ensures **correctness**, even if it's a bit slower.

---

## ‚ùì Why Not Use Machine Code from the Start?

### Memory Usage:

- Machine code takes up more memory than bytecode.

### Compilation Time:

- Machine code is slower to generate, delaying execution.

### Performance Trade-offs:

- Bytecode compiles faster but runs slower.
- Machine code takes longer to compile but runs blazing fast.

### Uncertainty in Code Behavior:

- JavaScript is dynamically typed ‚Äî types can change at runtime.
- It's better to observe the code first before optimizing, to avoid wrong assumptions.

---

## üí° Additional Notes & Concepts

### JIT Compilation (Just-In-Time):

- A hybrid strategy that starts with interpreting code and later compiles hot parts into machine code.
- Combines fast startup with high performance.

### Hot Code:

- Code that is executed many times.
- V8 prioritizes optimizing this code to make apps faster.

### Cold Code:

- Code that is rarely executed.
- Often left in bytecode form to save resources.

### Garbage Collection:

- V8 also handles memory cleanup.
- Works alongside the compiler to free unused memory ‚Äî essential when switching between compiled and interpreted code.

---

## üß† Summary

V8 uses **Ignition** for fast startup (bytecode) and **Turbofan** for high performance (optimized machine code).

This combination ensures JavaScript runs fast while staying flexible and efficient.

The whole system is designed to balance:

- ‚ö° Execution speed  
- üß† Memory usage  
- ‚úÖ Correctness of dynamic code
